# Kaspeak

**No one asked for this, but we did it!**  
Meet Kaspeak: the world’s first (probably) **voice (!) chat** in an open blockchain DAG. We also added a regular chat because the voice one barely works.  
Here is the simplest way to experience the full power and speed of Kaspa TN11, including 10 bps. All your messages (voice or text) are stored exclusively in blocks and spread across the entire network at a rate of 10 blocks per second. The ability to record arbitrary data inside blocks sparked this idea and led to its implementation in the form of Kaspeak.

## Important

1. **Never send real Kaspa.**  
   Kaspeak is intended strictly for the testnet and uses only the TKAS test currency. We do not accept donations or require any fees for its use. Any real funds sent anywhere will be lost forever!

2. **Do not use Kaspeak for anonymous or confidential information.**  
   Do not disclose personal data, schedule meetings, or conduct state affairs. Information transmitted through this service is publicly accessible throughout the entire test network. We also do not guarantee anonymity.

## How to Use It

1. **Download the client.**  
2. **Run the client.**  
3. For safety, toggle **mute all** (we truly don’t know what awaits you) or turn the volume down.  
4. Click the big green **Connect** button in the upper-right corner of the screen.  
   - Leave the field next to it blank if you don’t have your own TN11 node.  
5. Wait for the address to load and for the airdrop to be issued (the balance should become greater than 0).  
6. Experience a **dubious form of enjoyment**.  
7. When you’re ready (never) to test the voice chat, lower the volume and switch **mute all** to the “off” position.  
   - After that, you may even hear some intelligible sounds.  
   - To start speaking yourself, press the **Start Recording** button.  
8. Don’t forget to press **Stop Recording** again when you’ve finished your thought.  
   - Don’t keep recording on for too long—the delay grows over time.

## What Else Can Be Done

- **Adjust the fee** (0–10 TKAS) to expedite your own voice and text messages if needed.  
- **Choose from 10 million channels.**  
  - Voice and text are only visible and audible within the chosen channel.  
  - Occupy any free channel and explore Kaspa’s capabilities with a friend.  
- If you have no friends, that’s unfortunate—but it won’t stop you from experiencing Kaspa’s speed!  
  - Flip the **Listen Self** toggle to hear your own voice coming straight from the depths of the block DAG.

## What Can Go Wrong

Absolutely everything!  
- Failing to connect to a public node,  
- Inability to launch the application,  
- Crashes, lags, high latency,  
- UI layout errors, etc.  

These issues stem from extremely rushed development with little overall experience. If you believe Kaspeak isn’t working correctly, you’re probably right. In any unclear situation, you can:

- **Restart** the application.  
- **Delete** the `config` folder or the `default.toml` file.  

These two steps solve 99% of existing problems. If your case seems unique, you can send your `kaspeak.log` file here: [@kaspeak_support](https://t.me/kaspeak_support).
